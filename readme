Launching the program (JRE installation assumed):
run 'java Main' under ./target/classes/

Special cases:
1. Invalid command              -> prints error message and exits
2. Command incomplete           -> prints error message and await for next input
3. Out of range coordinates     -> prints error message and exits
4. Fill color set as 'x'        -> prints error message and exits (assumption: x is not a valid colour)
5. Drawing slant                -> prints error message and exits

Edge cases:
1. Drawing commands give same coordinates for both points -> draw dot (assumption: drawing dot is allowed)

Assumption:
1. Giving extra create command will not erase original canvas data, but reduce/expand the view of which user can draw
